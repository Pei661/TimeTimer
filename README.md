TimeTimer!
TimeTimer, which is a timer (PC) that allows you to run it conveniently in your daily life. Are you still annoyed that LiveSplit won't work, yes, if you're a speedrunner who challenges speedrunning, then you're definitely familiar with LiveSplit, and for new speedrunners who want to challenge speedrunning but can't use LiveSplit, this timer solves the problem of not using LiveSplit to practice in training. Maybe you can try this software.
1. It is convenient and fast, and it is very friendly to novices;
2. He is very streamlined and has a simple interface;
3. It's a top window, of course, this top window also has a defect, that is, the game can't be full-screen, otherwise the software won't be displayed (so it's still repairing bugs)
4. It is written in Python.
So, if you're still stopping your speedrunning practice because you can't use LiveSplit, try this timer.
